Basic Calculator App (Android - Kotlin)

This project is a simple calculator application developed using Kotlin for Android. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The main objective of this app is to help beginners understand how to build a functional Android app using Kotlin and learn how to handle user input, perform calculations, and update the user interface.

Features:

Perform basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

User-friendly interface with responsive buttons.

Real-time display of input and results.

Error handling for invalid operations, such as division by zero.

Clear (C) button to reset the input and result.

Technologies Used:

Kotlin: Main programming language used for developing the app logic.

Android Studio: Integrated development environment used to build and test the app.

XML: Used for designing the layout and interface of the application.

How to Run the App:

Clone or download the project source code to your local system.

Open the project using Android Studio.

Connect an Android device or start an emulator.

Click on the Run button to build and launch the app on the device.

How the App Works:

The user inputs numbers by tapping the number buttons.

After entering the first number, the user selects an operation (+, -, *, /).

The user then enters the second number.

By pressing the equals (=) button, the result of the operation is displayed.

The clear (C) button resets the input so the user can start a new calculation.

Project Structure:

The app contains one main activity written in Kotlin, which handles all user interactions and calculations. The layout is designed using XML in the activity_main.xml file. All buttons and display areas are connected to the Kotlin file using their IDs to perform operations when clicked.

Use Cases:

This app is suitable for:

Beginners learning Kotlin and Android development.

Students building a simple Android project.

Demonstrating the use of onClickListeners, UI components, and basic programming logic.

Learning Outcomes:

By working on this project, you will learn:

How to set up a basic Android project in Android Studio.

How to design layouts using XML.

How to handle button clicks and user input in Kotlin.

How to perform basic arithmetic operations.

How to update the user interface programmatically.

Conclusion:

This is a basic yet functional calculator app that serves as a good starting point for anyone interested in learning Android development with Kotlin. You can further improve this app by adding features such as decimal support, parentheses handling, scientific functions, or history tracking
